    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is a straightforward dough recipe for beginners. You only need six basic ingredients, plus some cornmeal to prepare the pan. (You can skip this if necessary.) As the dough rises, it's mostly hands-off. Why spend time when you can buy frozen pizza dough? Frozen pizza dough is undoubtedly handy, but homemade crust has unrivaled flavor and texture. </p>
